        <p>Like most communities, the Murray/Calloway County area has had its share of families facing absentee fathers, single parents, incarcerated parents, and children being raised by grandparents or foster parents. Add to that, challenges like poor school performance, behavior problems and self-esteem issues, children, regardless of parental situation, were in need of a means of intervention. Without it, their future would be one lacking success. The impact of such failure on communities would be great, negatively so.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
Thus in 1996, the problem was brought to the attention of Murray State University, specifically Dr. Roger Weis and the Youth and Non-Profit Leadership Students. After much research and study, they came to the conclusion that this area needed a “mentoring program.” It was decided that the solution was to affiliate with the national organization Big Brothers Big Sisters. With the help of the YNL Program, other faculty members and community leaders, funds were raised and Big Brothers Big Sisters of Murray/Calloway County agency was established. And "mentoring" in our area continues to remain it's legacy.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
Through the years, the agency experienced hurdles to overcome and growth resulting in success. National BBBS grew and expanded its thinking about local affiliates, deciding on a regional approach where agencies located geographically close would be grouped together. Murray/Calloway County joined with Trigg and Christian counties to form BBBS of the Southern Pennyrile, later renamed to BBBS of West KY.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
In July 2011, after almost 16 years of service to our area, BBBS of West KY was dissolved by vote of the governing Board of Directors. It is to be noted that the Murray/Calloway County office did close “in good standing” with the National Office after having successfully met all goals with over 100 matches, almost 100 children on the waiting list, a consistent supply of volunteers available and having met and exceeded all financial goals in fundraising.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
Yet the support of the community and individuals was obvious and committed to continue providing mentoring for the children in our area. So with strong resolve, a group of individuals from various areas of leadership met in August 2011 and formed a new, local agency to provide the services needed under the name of West KY Mentoring Inc. With the help of The Community Foundation of West Kentucky as our fiscal agent, we were able to take in donations and provide a tax deduction for our donors while we are in the process of getting our own 501c3  nonprofit status.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Presently, we are in our second year of operation to provide the same quality program. Every effort has been made to build a strong foundation for the agency. Expectations are high. To meet and exceed our vision, we depend on generous monetary gifts of support. The budget requires approximately $50,000 each year and the annual fundraiser, the Buddy Campaign, is intended to cover 70% of that amount. 
</p>
<br>
<p>
The future is bright, the need is ever present. Mentoring changes lives. We hope you will become involved  “Because Mentoring Matters!”</p>

        </div>
         <div class="row">
       <p>We are a site based one to one mentoring service for children ages 5 to 18. Most of our mentors visit the child at their school for 1 hour each week. Many of our mentors are Murray State Students. We are looking for more Community Adult mentors. We enroll children in our program by referrals and parent requests. The children simply need to have an academic or social need. The volunteers are thoroughly vetted by having an hour long interview/orientation appointment, three reference checks and a nationwide background check for criminal or domestic offences. 
       </p>
        <br>
        <p>Call our office to enroll your child, to volunteer, to be a mentor or to make your tax deductible donation.</p>
